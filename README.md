# Restaurant review app - Front end

Full stack project made using React JS for frontend part and Laravel for creating API resources stored in MySQL database.

App is designed to require user to create account and login first.
User is able to view data about restourants (titles, adresses..) and dishes available in those restaurants. Also user is able to rate dishes and see the average rating score. All data is fetched from the database.

Also admin account is available and admin can make CRUD operations - create, update and delete restaurants and dishes.
